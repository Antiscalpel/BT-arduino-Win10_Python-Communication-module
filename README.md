# BT-arduino-Win10_Python-Communication-module

Link to video of function test.  `https://youtu.be/9ag_VQeoAOg` 

This is a Bluetooth communication module based on PyGame sample to send commands with Joystick.
We connect a flightstick joystick on COM9 to send commands via Bluetooth on WIN10
To check the function we connect Arduino Serial Monitor on COM5
That is how we can initiate two way serial communication over Bluetooth.
I hope I will be able to troubleshoot C part of Arduino Roomba Control to show the setup in action.by or presentation meeting. 
Basically Roomba Control worked, while connected to Android phone, also with the feedback from ultrasonic radar. I could not make videos them, because the phone was busy. 

### Used modules: 
PySerial
PyGame

### WIN10 test equipment: Lenovo T420 + Broadcom BT builtin transmitter + IVT BlueSoleil Driver Package
